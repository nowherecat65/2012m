Well, they think it's not fair because it doesn't follow the rules laid out in the Constitution, which are like the instruction manual for how our country works. These rules are supposed to protect everyone's freedom, like making sure nobody tells you what you can or can't do without a good reason.\n\nBut that's not all. These upset folks are also worried that this program might actually make healthcare in America worse. Imagine going to the doctor, but things get even more complicated than they already are! That's not what anyone wants. Plus, they're saying it's going to cost a ton of money to keep this program up and running. And let's be real, money doesn't grow on trees!\n\nSo, to sum it up, some people are raising their voices because they think this program is a bad idea. They're concerned it's not playing by the rules, might make healthcare worse, and could drain our wallets if we don't change things up. Whew, that's a lot to think about!"

But don't worry, we can break it down into simpler terms.\n\nSo, imagine you're playing a game, but the rules keep changing, and it's super confusing. That's a bit like what's happening with healthcare. There's this thing called \"malpractice,\" which is when something goes wrong during medical treatment, and it's messy to sort out. We need to find a better way to handle these situations, so it's fair for everyone and doesn't cost a ton of money.\n\nAnd then there's the whole deal with using your health insurance. It's like trying to unlock a treasure chest, but there are so many locks and keys, it's a real headache. That's what we call \"red tape\" — all the complicated paperwork and rules that get in the way. If we can simplify all that, it'll be way easier for people to get the healthcare they need without feeling like they're lost in a maze.\n\nSo, instead of taking the wrong path, let's focus on fixing these things first. That's how we can make sure everyone can get the care they need without all the extra hassle."

You see, there are these companies called private insurers that handle health insurance, kinda like how you have different choices for video games. This program lets them keep doing their thing, which is important for competition and variety.\n\nBut here's the cool part: at the same time, it's making sure more people can actually get health insurance. Think of it like opening up a whole new level in a game so more players can join in. That means fewer folks left out in the cold without coverage when they need it most.\n\nAnd get this — the program promises to make things clearer and easier to understand. It's like turning on a bright light in a dark room, helping us see where all our money is going when we pay for insurance. And when things are clear, it usually means costs go down. So, not only does this program help more people get covered, but it might even save us some coins in the process!\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty convinced this program is a winner. It's like finding the perfect power-up in a game — it levels up the playing field for everyone."

Well, they say private insurance companies, which are like different companies you can choose from for insurance, can be a bit too focused on making money. It's like if you're playing a game and one player keeps all the coins for themselves instead of sharing with everyone else. Not cool, right?\n\nAnd here's the other thing: private insurers sometimes say no to people who have what we call \"pre-existing conditions.\" That's when you already have a health issue before you try to get insurance. It's like being told you can't join a game because you're not starting from the same place as everyone else. Not fair at all!\n\nSo, these folks are saying, \"Hey, let's have this big public insurance option that covers everyone, no matter what.\" That way, nobody gets left behind, and we're all in it together.

The Democrats made some gains too! They took back the House. People are super surprised that you did even better than last time. Obamacare is safe because you can say \"nope\" to any changes. </p> <p>Now you get to try again to fix the economy after the Bush recession. If things go well, you'll leave the country super strong for Hillary Clinton to take over in 2016!</p>",

The slow economy and your promises not matching up to your big talk in 2008 probably didn't help. The difference between now and 2008 is pretty huge, showing just how unpopular you've become. Even the Senate has turned red. Let's hope Romney's business smarts can help turn things around for the economy.</p> <p>Your time in politics is likely over, even though you're still pretty young. That's just how it goes for one-term presidents nowadays. But hey, maybe speaking gigs and book deals are in your future. You could be the next Jimmy Carter!<p> \n",
