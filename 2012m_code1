Elected four years ago on a moderate, maverick platform against Hillary Clinton, McCain has achieved some bipartisan success, including the passage of the Shelby-Bayh Financial Integrity Act in 2010, and the Stimulus Bill in 2009. However, he’s had to contend with an increasingly large Democratic Congress and Senate throughout his term. </p><p> McCain is currently trailing in the polls after a protracted primary battle with Rick Santorum, but he's expected to launch a focused ''experience counts'' campaign, taking aim at the so called, Do-Nothing Congress. Some in the press are already drawing comparisons to Harry Truman, and given his odds, the parallel isn’t too far-fetched.",

You have won the 2012 election.</h3><p>Holy hell, John, you've pulled it off! The major television networks just called the election for you; you have secured re-election and defeated Mark Warner!</p><p> On the immediate political front, you've gained some political capital, but at the end of the day, the Democratic Party still holds a significant majority in Congress, and they aren't going to be taking marching orders from you, sir. That said, an immigration bill or perhaps some action on climate change seems possible, especially with a can-do attitude and some glad-handing. Currently, most in the media are in shock at your political comeback; just a few months ago, you were considered practically dead in the water, and now here you are, preparing for another four years in the White House.</p><p> Already, the Democratic Party appears to be cracking at the seams. The progressive wing led by Bernie Sanders was never very enthusiastic about Mark Warner, and some Bernie voters outright refused to support him. The coming days will likely resemble a civil war within their own party... and we thought the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2008 was bad. Regardless, Bernie Sanders seems very likely to run again in 2016 and starts as the early Democratic favorite. As for the Republicans, now Vice President-elect Tim Pawlenty is more than willing to carry on the Maverick flame. </p><p>Whatever may come in the future, it's time for you to relax. Your approval rating has been low for the better part of 3.5 years, so perhaps these next four years could allow you to recover your popularity and leave as a well-liked man. Regardless, it's time to head upstairs and into bed. You'll need the sleep... </p>",
